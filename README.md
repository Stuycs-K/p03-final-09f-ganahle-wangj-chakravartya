### Project Description:

We plan on making a game called Higher or Lower, where one client chooses a number from 1-10, the server picks a random number within the same range, and then a second client has to guess whether the number of client #1 was above or below the number chosen by the computer.

### Instructions:

First, the client will connect, and upon another player's connection to the server, they will be prompted to accept a match via typing Y/N on their computer and return. Then, one of the players (randomly selected) will pick a random number from the range, and upon entering, the server will pick a random number from the range and the other player will have to guess as to whether the computer's number is above or below or equal to the first players' by clicking Y/N on their computer and entering. Also make compile, ./client, and ./server.
